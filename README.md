Car Price Prediction
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting car prices using machine learning. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes various attributes such as mileage, model year, brand, fuel type, etc.

cd car-price-prediction
Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and train the model.

Model Training
The train_model.ipynb notebook contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, and training the machine learning model.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Results
The trained model achieves [insert performance metrics here] on the test set. Visualizations and insights can be found in the results.ipynb notebook.
